# DockerPlayGround
Playground for Containers

This is my playpen where I intend to experiment with containerized solutions that will hopefully assist my learning and understanding of:
- Docker
- Swarms
- Containers
- Container managers such as Kubernetes

It would be ideal if I can succeed in getting some container tenants to talk to each other.
